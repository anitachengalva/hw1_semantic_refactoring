Hello! In this project I utilized semantic refactoring to better organize the HTML and CSS of a given webpage.
I implimented Class & ID selectors in CSS to better refactor the given code.
I also utilized Flexbox to justify content.

User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
